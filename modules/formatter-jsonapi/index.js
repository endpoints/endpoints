  The role of this module is to take a single model or collection of models
  and convert them into a representation that is json-api compliant.

  @param {Object} input - a bookshelf collection
  @param {Object} opts -
     singleResult: boolean indicating if result should be singular
                     this is needed because the querying system always
                     returns a collection--but sometimes you only want
                     a single item (e.g. /authors/1)
       relations: an array of dot-notated relation strings. these relations
                  are attached to the model and need to be extracted into
                  the top level included collection
       typeName: the type of the primary resource being requested
                 i think we might be able to remove this, it should always
                 be available off the collection
  @returns {Object|Array} json-api compliant formatted response
