## What is it?
A pluggable hypermedia API framework compatible with any node http server or data store.

Endpoints comes with a built in formatter for the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) specification and a storage adapter for [Bookshelf](http://bookshelfjs.org/).

*Check out the [example implementation](https://github.com/endpoints/example).*
