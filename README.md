# endpoints [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/endpoints/endpoints.png)](http://travis-ci.org/endpoints/endpoints)
> a hypermedia API framework for javascript.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/endpoints.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/endpoints/)

# What is it?
A hypermedia API framework compliant with the [json api](http://jsonapi.org) specification, compatible with any node http server.

*Check out the [example implementation](https://github.com/endpoints/example).*

### Endpoints.Application
A container for your API. All resources are registered with it, and all route handlers for your API should be created using it. This is mainly for making it possible to generate self-documentation. *Something* in the Endpoints stack needs to be aware of every resource/route created in the API. Further down the road, this could be used to do all sorts of magical convention-based stuff like creating admin interfaces, interactive API documentation, etc.

For a more comprehensive explanation, [see the README](https://github.com/endpoints/endpoints/blob/master/modules/application/README.md).

### Endpoints.Source
This is a thin wrapper for any ORM. Typically you will never interact with a Source directly. It presents a standardized, callback-based API that can communicate with `Endpoints.Controller`. There is currently only one implementation: `Endpoints.BookshelfSource`.

For a more comprehensive explanation, [see the README](https://github.com/endpoints/endpoints/blob/master/modules/source-bookshelf/README.md).

### Endpoints.Controller
This provides methods for generating CRUD request handling functions. Each controller is associated with a single `Source` instance. The API is very simple, providing `create`, `read`, `update`, & `destroy` methods, each of which can be configured with an options object.

For a more comprehensive explanation, [see the README](https://github.com/endpoints/endpoints/blob/master/modules/controller/README.md).
